### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name's Bader, also known as Starlk. A university student whose hobby is making computers confused.

I started programming around 2020 by picking up Python, then C# which I've fallen in love with.

My favorite game is Minecraft as you can probably tell by the fact that most of my repositories are in a way or other related to it.
But I also enjoy writing desktop apps, some Web APIs, and other projects that I happen to find interesting!

You can find me in the C# Discord community. I don't use X that much.

Feel free to explore my repositories. My personal favorites are pinned below this text block.

Thanks for stopping by, wonderful reader!
