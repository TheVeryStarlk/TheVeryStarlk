### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name's Bader - also known as Starlk, a university student whose hobby is confusing computers.

I started programming around 2020 by picking up Python, then C# which I've fallen in love with.

I enjoy writing desktop apps, Web APIs, and other projects that I happen to find interesting!
If the sheer number of Minecraft-related repositories didn't give it away already, then, yeah, Minecraft's my favorite.

You can find me in the C# Discord community. I don't use X that much.

Feel free to explore my repositories. My personal favorite ones are pinned below this text block.

Thanks for stopping by, wonderful reader!
