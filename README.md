# Hello, world!

My name's Bader - also known as Starlk, a university student whose hobby is confusing computers.

Started programming by picking up Python, then C# which I've fallen in love with.\
I enjoy building desktop applications, Web APIs, plus projects that I happen to find interesting! Oh, I also play Minecraft.

You can find me in the [C# Discord](https://discord.gg/csharp) community. I don't use X that much.\
Feel free to explore my repositories, my personal favorite ones are pinned below this text block.

Thanks for stopping by, wonderful reader!
